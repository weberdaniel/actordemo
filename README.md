# A supervisor demo of C++ Actor Framework (CAF)

This project shall demonstrate the capabilities of the C++ Actor Framework (CAF)
on the example of a lightweight C++ supervisor process that monitors another lightweight 
C++ process and restarts it in case of an error.

## Reactive Software Design

<img align='left' src="https://github.com/weberdaniel/supervisor-demo/blob/main/doc/images/reactive_design.jpg" width="230">

The principle of reactive software design patterns have gained significant momentum in particular due to highly distributed
software architectures, but also due to the rise of multi-core systems. Accordingly, design patterns formerly used for
telecommunication software like used in the Erricson Switch AXD301 enabling its nine-nines reliability (99.9999999%), 
become adopted to other programming domains as well. 

To spread this design principles the Reactive Manifesto has been created: https://www.reactivemanifesto.org
