This project shall demonstrate the capabilities of the C++ Actor Framework (CAF)
on the example of a lightweight C++ supervisor process that monitors another lightweight 
C++ process and restarts it in case of an error. This shall resemble the capabilities
of an Erlang Supervisor - which has different supervising strategies (e.g. one_for_one) 
and can be used to span complex and distributed supervision hierarchies (called applications).

## Build & Run:

This is clearly the best way, it will download all sources and will build everything locally
in lightweigt Alpine docker containers and create the docker images locally. This avoids 
large downloads. Note to define all variables, especially define the number_of_build_jobs,
and don't make it exceed 

export http_proxy=/&ยง)$&)  # set the proxy for downloading sources
export https_proxy=)=&=)& # set the proxy for downloading sources
export number_of_build_jobs=20 # don't use more threads than cpu cores
export DOCKER\_BUILDKIT=1 # enable parallel build in docker
docker compose build # build everything
docker compose run # start everything

## Actor Frameworks and Reactive Design

Actor Frameworks are a crucial building block for Artificial Intelligence. Actor Frameworks have been first introduced by 
Carl Hewitt, Peter Bishop und Richard Steiger in 1973.

### The C++ Actor Framework

<td> A notable modern implementation of an Actor Framework in C++ is CAF, the C++ Actor Framework (https://www.actor-framework.org). In contrary to programming middleware like CORBA or ACE, it uses modern C++ to improve memory management, performance and type safety. </td>

Some highlights:

- leverage on C++ high performance
- low memory footprint
- native bindings to Prometheus DB for high-performance data science in real-time
- Resilience due to Reactive Design
- Scalability
- Tight memory control
- modern c++
- used for high-performance network analysis (Zeek)
- Actors blend into Qt Widgets seamlessly by deriving from caf::mixin::actor_widget<QWdiget> 

### Reactive Software Design: Make your software fault tolerant!

<td> The principle of reactive software design patterns reaches back to the 1970s. A famous example of a reactive software design is the AXD301 Ericsson switch, which provides a nine-nines reliability (99.9999999%), which is basically a millisecond of downtime per year. Since highly distributed software architectures are common - reactive design patterns have been rediscovered and become relevant on hardware related software domains as well. Examples for this are the IoT. But also tech companies aim for a decentralized fault-tolerant data center technology. For example Microsoft is testing out underwater distributed data centers. Multi-core CPUs can be regarded as distributed systems as well. Therefore the design principles of devices like the Ericsson switch AXD301 are getting rediscovered and become implemented on other programming domains as well. Since today any kind of software can be regarded as a part of a distributed architecture, reactive design patterns can be applied to almost any software that should be fault-tolerant and highly reliable. This is reflected in the creation of the Reactive Manifesto in order to spread word about the design concepts: https://www.reactivemanifesto.org

### An example design pattern: "Crash me if you can"
  
The 'Let it crash'/'Crash me if you can' pattern is one of the elementary design patterns of the domain. In order to build fault-tolerant software, a common design pattern is to  only code for the applcation usecase - in any other usecase - the process will just crash and be restarted. The result looks like the following:

<br><br>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/weberdaniel/supervisor-demo/raw/main/doc/images/restart.png" width="50%" alt><br>
<em>Child process is being restarted by the supervisor</em>
</div>
<br>
  
The Erlang specification of a supervisor is slightly more complex and incorporates various strategys on how to recover an array of processes. For example if one child process crashes all need to be restarted. To understand what i build here in C++, you can look at the definition in Erlang which is given here: https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html
  
#### One for One Strategy

#### One for All Strategy

## Aims and Goals

The goal of this project is to implement an Erlang supervision hierarchy inside a C++ high performance application, as closly as possible resembling the principles of Erlang, but in the domain of high performance computing. 
  
## Limitations

Currently one_for_one, one_for_all, rest_for_one strategy is implemented,
but not simple_one_for_one. Also currently this only works with function object 
(functor) based actors, not class based actors or function based actors.
    
## Contribution  

In SCRUM you usually find a DEFINITION OF DONE, telling what is expected of the code quality. In this case there is no scrum team, but still a Definition of Done is used as far as possible (Reviews are not always possible) - still i have to admit - whithout a proper review process working alone will never be comparable to working in a SCRUM team.

### The Definition of Done:
  
- Fullfillment of Google Coding Style (cpplint must give 0 errors)
- C++ Core Guidelines must be kept : https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines
- Another Person must review the code
- Unit Test must be > 80%
- Memory Check with Valgrind
- Code Coverage > 80%
