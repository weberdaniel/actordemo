# A supervisor demo of C++ Actor Framework (CAF)

This project shall demonstrate the capabilities of the C++ Actor Framework (CAF)
on the example of a lightweight C++ supervisor process that monitors another lightweight 
C++ process and restarts it in case of an error.

## Reactive Software Design

The principle of reactive software design patterns have gained significant momentum in particular due to highly distributed
software architectures, but also due to the rise of multi-core systems. Accordingly, former design patterns mainly used for
telecommunication software like the Erricson Switch AXD301 and the Erlang programming langue, become adopted to other programming 
languages and domains as well. To foster this spread the Reactive Manifesto has been created https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/de
